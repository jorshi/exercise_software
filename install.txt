This project was developed using XCode 7.0.1.

- Building requires Google Protocol Buffers version 2.6.1, see the online
instructions for installation: https://github.com/google/protobuf
- After install Protocol buffers, make sure the library included in
the XCode linked binary is correct and the "Header Search Paths" &
"Library Search Paths" are correct for the location that protobuf was
installed. These are modified in the build settgins for the ExerciseSoftware
product.

- Run build in XCode

- Google Testing Framework is required to compile and run the unittests
for this application. Refer to https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_XcodeGuide
for information on setting up with XCode.
- After installing the framework, ensure that the "Framework Search Paths" variable
in build settings for the Tests product are set to the location you installed the
framework.
