# Exercise Software Application

The purpose of this software is to provide a way for employees
of a gym to easily add and keep track of exercise equipment currently
in their gym. Currently this software implements a Prototype design
pattern and supports additions of exercise bicycles and treadmills.

New equipment additions are serialized and stored using Google Protocol
